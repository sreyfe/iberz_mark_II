Hello! This is a database of translations into Yiddish put together by me, [Jonah Lubin](https://jonahlubin.net/), for my Master's thesis at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. At present, it consists of about 2,000 entries. Each entry is a book from the [Yiddish Book Center's digital library](https://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/collections/digital-yiddish-library). I have annotated these entries with data relevant to their status as translations: original title, original author, original language, translator. I have also begun to link these translations to their originals with Wikidata ID's. This is a work in progress, and this website will soon look quite different.

To look at the code for this project, [see here](https://github.com/sreyfe/iberz/). If you want to download the database as a JSON, you can find it [here](https://github.com/sreyfe/berz_data).

I will soon begin the process of expanding the database beyond the books from the Yiddish Book Center. If you know of a translation into Yiddish, or have found an error, I would love to hear about it! You can reach me at jonah0lubin \[at\] gmail.com.
