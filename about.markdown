Hello! This is a database of translations into Yiddish put together by me, [Jonah Lubin](https://jonahlubin.net/), for my Master's thesis at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. At present, I have collected over 1,300 translations, all of which come from the [Yiddish Book Center's digital library](https://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/collections/digital-yiddish-library). I have annotated these entries with data relevant to their status as translations: source text 
(of which there are over 1,200), original author, original language, translator. I have also begun to link these translations to their originals with Wikidata id's.

To look at the code for this project, [see here](https://github.com/sreyfe/iberz_mark_ii). The website is hosted using [Github Pages](https://github.com/sreyfe/iberz). If you want to take a look at the data, you can find it [here](https://github.com/sreyfe/iberz_data).

I will soon begin the process of expanding the database beyond the books from the Yiddish Book Center. If you know of a translation into Yiddish, or have found an error, 
or just want to say hello, I would love to hear from you! You can reach me at jonah0lubin \[at\] gmail.com.
